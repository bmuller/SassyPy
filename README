The goal of SassyPy is enhanced handling of CSV files, to possibly include:
  - Sorting large files
  - Moving cursors to arbitrary lines
  - Intelligent use of in-memory operations and parallelism where appropriate
  - Merging files
  - Metadata (not only names of columns, but line count, sort status...)
  - Indexing
  - SQL operations, via SQLite

The inspiration comes from the SAS data step, but obviously is not wedded to it.
